          Hi, I'm Adam. I'm a junior web developer from the Twin Cities (Minnesota), where I'm
          currently located.{' '}
          <span className="font-bold">
            I'm seeking a full-time junior web developer position in Colorado
          </span>
          , so if you're hiring in Colorado, read on! ðŸ™‚
        </p>
        <p className="p-2">
          I graduated from the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities in 2014 with a B.A. History.
          Although I majored in history, I sampled as broadly as possible during college, studying
          mostly physical and biological sciences. I also studied Japanese language and culture for
          one semester in Chiba, Japan, in 2013.
        </p>
        <p className="p-2">
          After college, I moved to Sejong City, South Korea, where I taught elementary school
          English in Korean public schools for six years. During that time, I developed an original
          "alphabet-gardening" Windows desktop game,{' '}
          <a
            className="underline text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 visited:text-purple-600 hover:scale-110 transition-all ease-in-out duration-200"

          </a>
          , which has been played at school and home by more than 1,000 of my students in grades 3
          and 4. I also responded to the many COVID-19 school closures, immediately and
          continuously, by developing online and hybrid lessons alongside my Korean colleagues. It
          was during this quiet period of social distancing that I began to engage in intensive,
          self-directed language learning (Korean and Japanese in parallel). As a result, I was able
          to pass TOPIK Level 2 (Test of Proficiency in Korean) and use what I learned as a language
          learner to develop improved lessons and materialsâ€”using emoji and translation directly in
          the textâ€”to help my students use English with greater ease and confidence.
        </p>
        <p className="p-2">
          I returned home in October 2022, and by December, I began learning web development using
          free, open-source coursework, docs, articles, YouTube videos, etc. Now, I'm refactoring
          and continuing to learn on top of the small codebase that I've built while I seek a
          position that will allow me to continue doing my best work, this time, in the field of web
          development.
